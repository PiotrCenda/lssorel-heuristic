# lssorel heuristic

Implementation of xLastovka algorithm [[1]](#1) - a heuristic algorithm for low autocorelation binary sequence problem.

### About

The project was written in Python using the PyGad framework as a backbone providing a mechanism to carry out an evolutionary algorithm, to which we add an implemented extension.

### Results

to be added
